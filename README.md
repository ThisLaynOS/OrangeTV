# 📖 About

OrangeTV OS is an Android TV firmware created specifically for the **Orange Pi 3B (RK3566)**.

Unlike traditional ROM ports, this project is **not based on an existing Android TV ROM**.

Instead, the firmware is built by studying Google's Android TV implementation and recreating the required components through reverse engineering while adapting them to the Rockchip platform.

The goal is to provide a modern Android TV experience while keeping compatibility with Orange Pi hardware.
